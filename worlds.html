					<p> Worlds is finally here. This year, Worlds is taking place in Montreal, a city steeped in history for the gymnastics world. Montreal was the host of the 1976 Olympic Games, where Romania's Nadia Comaneci scored the world's first perfect 10. She was just 14 years old. Since then, the sport has evolved leaps and bounds. In honor of Worlds coming back to the home of the perfect 10, I will explain how the sport has changed since that defining moment as a way to understand how we got go to where we are today: the 2017 World Championships.
						</p>

					<p>  If Nadia were a gymnast today, she would be ineligible from competing at Worlds. Gymnasts are now required to be at least 16 or turning 16 in the the calendar year to compete in senior competitions. The lucky few that are born during an Olympic year will be eligible to compete right when they turn 16, and when it comes to gymnastics, the younger they are, the lighter they are, the more flexible, and more fearless. Still, that doesn't stop 42-year-old mother Oksana Chusotivina, who is still competing at these championships on vault at the highest levels. </p>

					<p>The scoring system--The Code of Points (COP)--is another aspect that has changed. In 2006, the International Gymnastics Federation (FIG)--the international governing body for gymnastics--completely overhauled the perfect 10 system to what we have today. Even though the last perfect 10 was awarded at the 1992 Barcelona Games, FIG stuck with that system until 2006, only making minor adjustments to how a routine's difficulty and deductions were computed out of 10. After <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN8PnQCdtM8">several</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XR_-QI3bVFA">judging</a> <a href="http://www.latimes.com/la-102104hamm-gold_lat-story.html">controversies</a> during and outside the 2004 Athens Games, the objectivity of the perfect 10 system was called into question, prompting the overhaul.</p>

					<p>In the current system, the final score consists of the D-score and the E-score, representing a routine's difficulty and execution. The D-score itself consists of the skills performed, connection bonuses between those skills, and the four composition requirements for each apparatus. The E-score is out of 10, and the judges make deductions from there. Still, there will never be perfect 10 E-score; even routines that are seemingly perfect, like McKayla Maroney's 
					team final vault at the 2012 London Games, which incurred 0.266 of deductions, will not receive a perfect score. While detractors of the current system may say that getting rid of the perfect 10 system--especially in a sport that holds perfection dear--pushes away casual viewers of the sport, the current code has made scoring more transparent and fairer.</p>

					<p> It's the year after an Olympic year, so FIG reworked the code for this quad, making adjustments to how skills are valued, where connection bonuses are given, and what kinds of deductions are taken, etc. In 2008, commentators frequently talked about how Valeri Liukin, coach and father of 2008 Olympic All-Around champion Nastia Liukin, constructed the perfect bar routine for Nastia to earn a huge score. Every time the code changes, gymnasts and their coaches pore over these details of the code, leveraging it to maximize their scoring potential on each event. Worlds this year is especially exciting because we get to see fresh routines of the new code. There's also no team competition following an Olympic year, so it's each gymnast for herself.</p>
						
					

					
					<p> From the 1950s until its dissolution, the Soviet Union held an iron grip on gymnastics, winning almost all of the team and individual medals at each Worlds and Olympics. Most of the other participants were other eastern European countries like Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Romania. One of the more important changes gymnastics has gone through is the diversity of countries that participate and contend for medals in the sport today. Below, I've shown all the countries that are participating in Worlds this year, along with whether that country has medaled at a Worlds in the past. Mousing over each country shows the gymnasts participating from that country this year. </p> 
						
					<div class="graphholder" id="countriesgraph">
						<svg id="countriessvg" width="1000" height="650"></svg>
						<p>Currently, the "Big Three" countries are the USA, Russia, and China. Romania used to be in the mix, but following their disaster at the 2015 World Championships, they haven't been able to field a new Worlds-ready team, relying on veterans Larisa Iordache and Catalina Ponor to keep their program afloat. Japan, Brazil, Canada, Great Britain, and Germany are countries with medium-sized programs and in the mix for medals this year. The graph also shows Belgium in blue--Belgium is looking for its medal in women's gymnastics, and European bars champion Nina Derwael is looking like she could be the first.

					beam mounts increased
					no more than three leements of out root skill
					D-difficulty dismounts removed dance and acro series (mixed)
					floor requires both front and back tumbling</p>
					<h3> The Contenders </h3>
					<p> For the following five graphs, I compiled data for all the gymnasts I think are medal contenders for the all-around and each event final by aggregating their maximum score and average score from all of their competitions this season. These competitions include both the World Cup circuit and their country's national championships. Because of score inflation at national championships, it's hard to compare E-scores between gymnasts, so the graphs may not be an accurate reflection of who will place where. However, the D-scores show what each gymnast is capable of and can be used to gauge who has the potential to win.

						<h3> Vault </h3>
						<p> Vault underwent several scoring adjustments under the new code. Because the new code removed the D-dismount requirement, effectively lowering D-scores by 0.5 on the other events, the new code decreased the D-scores of all vaults to account for this change. Some vaults were hit harder than others. For example, the D-score for the Amanar (a Yurchenko with 2.5 twists), which has been the U.S. team's trump card in winning the last six team competitions at the Worlds and Olympics, was reduced to from 6.3 to 5.8, while the Rudi (a front handspring with with 1.5 twists) was reduced from 6.2 to 5.8. Below are the contenders for the vault final.

						</div>
						<div class="graph" id="vtgraph">
						</div>
						<p>The 2015 World Champion Maria Paseka is the favorite here, but she has shown some inconsistency with her Amanar this season, and she hasn't unveiled her Cheng (a Yurchenko half-on with 1.5 twists) yet, a vault with a D-score of 6.0. With it, she will have the highest combined D-score. When sorting by escore1, you can see that Paseka doesn't have the highest execution scores due to her leg form in the flight phase, but her D-score advantage may be enough to offset this.Although Giulia Steingruber is in last place here, she has been recovering from an injury and hasn't shown full difficulty. She's capable of a Rudi (5.8) and a Yurchenko with 2 twists (5.4). American Jade Carey is a definite medal contender with her Amanar and Kasamatsu with a full twist (5.6). Because she has the power that gives her more amplitude on her vaults, she has better form than most others. If her landings are clean, she could win gold. Finally, despite being 42, Oksana Chusovitina always manages to sneak into the vault final, a testament to her longevity in the sport.  </p>

						</div>

						</div>
						<p>Bars is where Russia and China shine. Russia's Elena Eremina performs a Nabieva (toe-on laidout Tkachev), a G-skill, the hardest release being done in the competition. With the highest D-score (6.3), Fan Yilin has beautifully concise routine, doing all of her skills within two connections, along with a unique dismount that could be named after her. Nina Derwael is trying to earn Belgium's first gymnastics medal, and she could have a new release move (a stalder Tkachev with a half turn) named after her in the process. American Ashton Locklear doesn't have as big of a D-score (5.5) than the other contenders, but she has the best execution by far with her perfect handstands and beautiful lines. She hasn't shown her inbars at selection camp, so we can assume she's not ready to compete them. With inbars, she has a D-score potential of 6.0. Daria Varinska is representing Ukraine, a former country with multiple multiple Olympic all-around winners, but hasn't had a gymnast in the finals since 2010. With her routine, she could qualify to bars finals and have a shot to medal. Romania has been notoriously weak on the uneven bars, but Larisa Iordache has shown incredible improvement on bars, and she could potentially make event finals with her D-score alone (6.2). She is also debuting a Fabrichnova (double twisting double tuck) dismount, an F-skill.</p>

						<h3> Balance Beam </h3>
						<p> In this code, several mounts were bumped up by 0.1 in difficulty. After Alicia Sacramone's fall on her front tuck mount at the 2008 Olympic Team Final, the U.S. and other countries have stuck to relatively safe mounts, packing the rest of their routines with difficulty. With this code, gymnasts are rewarded for more creative mounts. In addition, this beam code is all about connecting elements, awarding connection bonuses for mixed series (dance + acrobatic). Many gymnasts have been performing a front aerial (D) + split jump (B) + straddle jump (B) for 0.2 connection bonus. The Chinese beam workers have done an especially good job with this code, connecting difficult leaps with acrobatic elements.

						</div>
						<div class="graph" id="bbgraph">
						</div>
				
						<p>Larisa Iordache is a favorite to win the beam title, with her two super difficult acrobatic series, which include a layout with a full twist (G) and full twisting back tuck (F), giving her the highest D-score potential. China's Liu Tingting displays her flexibility in her jumps and leaps, and she does almost all of her skills in connection, racking up over a point in connection bonus. Romania's Catalina Ponor was the 2004 Olympic beam champion, and she is still looking for her first gold medal at Worlds. In true Romanian fashion, she works the beam with a rhythm, moving from skill to skill effortlessly, connecting several elements together. Ragan Smith has been consistent on beam, and she has received the highest E-score this season. Spin queen and 2016 Olympic beam champion Sanne Wevers is also looking for her first Worlds medal, but she has looked less in form than in the previous year.

					</p> Several people have Chusovitinas (Full twisting double layout)
					Ponor has been training hers
					Ragan Smith tumbling isnt as hard but she's consistent
					Japanese have the biggest tumbling
					Jade Carey is close behind
					</div>
					<h3> 2017 and Looking Onward </h3>
					Difficulty of routines has gone up since 2006
					More risk, more reward
					connections are being rewarded more in the current COP, 
					but judges are stingy to award them
					more leaps are being done in beam, but correct form is paramount
					The perfect 10 is gone, so now detractors complain it's all about difficulty, gymnastics has lost its artistry in favor of artistry
					Routines can be difficult but still beautiful, eg Morgan Hurd
