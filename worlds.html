					<p> Worlds is finally here. This year, Worlds is taking place in Montreal, a city steeped in history for the gymnastics world. Montreal was the host of the 1976 Olympic Games, where Romania's Nadia Comaneci scored the world's first perfect 10. She was just 14 years old. Since then, the sport has evolved leaps and bounds. In honor of Worlds coming back to the home of the perfect 10, I will explain how the sport has changed since that defining moment as a way to understand how we got go to where we are today: the 2017 World Championships.
						</p>

					<p>  If Nadia were a gymnast today, she would be ineligible from competing at Worlds. Gymnasts are now required to be at least 16 or turning 16 in the the calendar year to compete in senior competitions. The lucky few that are born during an Olympic year will be eligible to compete right when they turn 16, and when it comes to gymnastics, the younger they are, the lighter they are, the more flexible, and more fearless. Still, that doesn't stop 42-year-old mother Oksana Chusotivina, who is still competing at these championships on vault at the highest levels. </p>

					<p>The scoring system--The Code of Points (COP)--is another aspect that has changed. In 2006, the International Gymnastics Federation (FIG)--the international governing body for gymnastics--completely overhauled the perfect 10 system to what we have today. Even though the last perfect 10 was awarded at the 1992 Barcelona Games, FIG stuck with that system until 2006, only making minor adjustments to how a routine's difficulty and deductions were computed out of 10. After <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN8PnQCdtM8">several</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XR_-QI3bVFA">judging</a> <a href="http://www.latimes.com/la-102104hamm-gold_lat-story.html">controversies</a> during and outside the 2004 Athens Games, the objectivity of the perfect 10 system was called into question, prompting the overhaul.</p>

					<p>In the current system, the final score consists of the D-score and the E-score, representing a routine's difficulty and execution. The D-score itself consists of the skills performed, connection bonuses between those skills, and the four composition requirements for each apparatus. The E-score is out of 10, and the judges make deductions from there. Still, there will never be perfect 10 E-score; even routines that are seemingly perfect, like McKayla Maroney's 
					team final vault at the 2012 London Games, which incurred 0.266 of deductions, will not receive a perfect score. While detractors of the current system may say that getting rid of the perfect 10 system--especially in a sport that holds perfection dear--pushes away casual viewers of the sport, the current code has made scoring more transparent and fairer.</p>

					<p> It's the year after an Olympic year, so FIG reworked the code for this quad, making adjustments to how skills are valued, where connection bonuses are given, and what kinds of deductions are taken, etc. In 2008, commentators frequently talked about how Valeri Liukin, coach and father of 2008 Olympic All-Around champion Nastia Liukin, constructed the perfect bar routine for Nastia to earn a huge score. Every time the code changes, gymnasts and their coaches pore over these details of the code, leveraging it to maximize their scoring potential on each event. Worlds this year is especially exciting because we get to see fresh routines of the new code. There's also no team competition following an Olympic year, so it's each gymnast for herself.</p>
						
					

					
					<p> From the 1950s until its dissolution, the Soviet Union held an iron grip on gymnastics, winning almost all of the team and individual medals at each Worlds and Olympics. Most of the other participants were other eastern European countries like Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Romania. One of the more important changes gymnastics has gone through is the diversity of countries that participate and contend for medals in the sport today. Below, I've shown all the countries that are participating in Worlds this year, along with whether that country has medaled at a Worlds in the past. Mousing over each country shows the gymnasts participating from that country this year. </p>
