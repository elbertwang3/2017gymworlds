					<p> Worlds is finally here. This year, Worlds is taking place in Montreal, a city steeped in history for gymnastics. Montreal was the host of the 1976 Olympic Games, where Romania's Nadia Comaneci scored the world's first perfect 10 in the sport. She was just 14 years old. She's here at these championships, 41 years later, and since then, the sport has evolved leaps and bounds. So how did we get from the era of the perfect 10 to where we are today?</p>

					<p>  If Nadia were a gymnast today, she would be ineligible from competing at a world championships. Gymnasts are now required to be at least 16 or turning 16 in the the calendar year to compete in senior competitions. The lucky few that are born during an Olympic year will be eligible to compete right when they turn 16, and when it comes to gymnastics, the younger they are, the lighter they are, the more flexible, and more fearless. Still, that doesn't stop 42-year-old mother Oksana Chusotivina, who is still competing at these championships on vault at the highest levels. </p>

					<p>The scoring system--The Code of Points (COP)--is another aspect that has changed. In 2006, the International Gymnastics Federation (FIG)--the international governing body for gymnastics--completely overhauled the perfect 10 system to what we have today. Even though the last perfect 10 was awarded at the 1992 Barcelona Games, FIG stuck with that system until 2006, only making minor adjustments to how a routine's difficulty and deductions were computed out of 10. After <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN8PnQCdtM8">several</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XR_-QI3bVFA">judging</a> <a href="http://www.latimes.com/la-102104hamm-gold_lat-story.html">controversies</a> during and outside the 2004 Athens Games, the objectivity of the perfect 10 system was called into question, prompting the overhaul.</p>

					<p>In the current system, the final score consists of a D-score and E-score, representing a routine's difficulty and execution. The D-score consists of the skills performed, connection bonuses between those skills, and the four composition requirements for each event. The E-score starts at a 10, and the judges make deductions from there. Still, there will never be perfect 10 E-score; even routines that are seemingly perfect--like McKayla Maroney's team final vault at the 2012 London Games which incurred 0.266 of deductions--will not receive a perfect score. While detractors of the current system may say that getting rid of the perfect 10 system in a sport that holds perfection dear pushes away casual viewers of the sport, the current code has made scoring more transparent and and in effect, fairer.</p>

					<p> It's the year after an Olympic year, so FIG reworked the code for the 2017-2020 quad, making adjustments to how skills are valued, where connection bonuses are given, and what kinds of deductions are taken, etc. In 2008, commentators frequently talked about how Valeri Liukin, coach and father of 2008 Olympic All-Around champion Nastia Liukin, constructed the perfect bar routine for Nastia to earn a huge score. Every time the code changes, gymnasts and their coaches pore over these details of the code, leveraging it to construct routines that maximize their scoring potential on each event. Worlds this year is especially exciting because we get to see fresh routines of the new code. There's also no team competition following an Olympic year, so it's each gymnast for herself.</p>
						
					<p> From the 1950s until its dissolution, the Soviet Union held an iron grip on gymnastics, winning almost all of the team and individual medals at each Worlds and Olympics. Most of the other participants were other eastern European countries like Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Romania. One of the more important changes gymnastics has gone through is the diversity of countries that participate and contend for medals in the sport today. Below, I've shown all the countries that are participating in Worlds this year, along with whether that country has medaled at a world championships in the past. Mousing over each country shows the gymnasts participating from that country this year. </p> 
						
					<div class="graphholder" id="countriesgraph">
						<svg id="countriessvg" width="1000" height="650"></svg>
						<p>Currently, the "Big Three" countries are the USA, Russia, and China. Romania used to be in the mix, but since the 2012 London Olympics, their program has been on the decline, and they've relied on veterans Larisa Iordache and Catalina Ponor to keep their program afloat. Japan, Brazil, Canada, Great Britain, and Germany are countries with medium-sized programs and in the mix for medals this year. The graph also shows Belgium in blue--Belgium is looking for its medal in women's gymnastics, and European bars champion Nina Derwael is looking like she could be the first. 
						</p>

					<h3> The Contenders </h3>
					<p> For the following five graphs, I compiled data for all the gymnasts I think are medal contenders for the all-around and the event finals by aggregating their maximum score and average score from all of their competitions this season. These competitions include both the World Cup circuit and national championships. Because of score inflation at national championships, it's hard to compare E-scores between gymnasts, so the graphs may not be an accurate reflection of who will place where. However, the D-scores show what each gymnast is capable of and can be used to gauge who has the potential to win.
					<div class="graphholder" id="allaroundgraph">
						<h3> All-Around </h3>
						<p> With Simone Biles on hiatus this year, the all-around is anyone's title. Ragan Smith and Larisa Iordache are the heavy favorites, with Larisa having won the silver in 2014 and the bronze in 2015 in the All-Around, and Ragan showing high difficulty and consistency all season. Morgan Hurd was the U.S.'s wildcard pick for the team this year, having shown inconsistency earlier in the season. However, she is a true all-arounder, with D-scores that could make her a dark horse. Some other contenders are more lop-sided, like Mai Murakami, who specializes in vault and floor exercise, and Elena Eremina, who could close the gap with her bars routine.

						<h3> Vault </h3>
						<p> Vault underwent several scoring adjustments under the new code. Because the new code removed the D-value dismount requirement, effectively lowering D-scores by 0.5 on the other events, the new code decreased the D-scores of all vaults to account for this change. Some vaults were hit harder than others. For example, the D-score for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNG0QJw7-4A">Amanar</a>, which has been the U.S. team's trump card in winning the last six team competitions at Worlds and the Olympics, was reduced to from 6.3 to 5.8, while the <a href="images/rudi.gif">Rudi</a> was reduced from 6.2 to 5.8. In a sport with tiny margins of error, every tenth counts. Below are the contenders for the vault final. 
						<div class="inputs">

							<label><input class="vtradio" type="radio" name="vtdataset" id="dataset" value="0" checked> Maximum scores</label>

						</div>
						<div class="graph" id="vtgraph">
						</div>
						<p>The 2015 World Champion Maria Paseka is the favorite here, but she has shown some inconsistency with her Amanar this season, and she hasn't unveiled her <a href="images/cheng.gif">Cheng</a> yet, a vault with a D-score of 6.0. With it, she will have the highest combined D-score. When sorting by escore1, you can see that Paseka doesn't have the highest execution scores due to her leg form in the flight phase, but her D-score advantage may be enough to compensate and win her the title. Although Giulia Steingruber is in last place here, she has been recovering from an injury and hasn't shown full difficulty. She's capable of a Rudi (5.8) and a <a href="images/yurchenkodouble.gif">Yurchenko with 2 twists</a> (5.4). American Jade Carey is a definite medal contender with her Amanar and <a href="images/tsukdouble.gif">Tsukuhara with 2 twists</a> (5.6). Because she has the power that gives her more amplitude on her vaults, she has better form than most others. If her landings are clean, she could win gold. Finally, despite being 42, Oksana Chusovitina might manage to sneak into the vault final again, a testament to her longevity in the sport.  </p>

						<h3> Uneven Bars </h3>
						<p> Bars received small changes in the new code, with some common skills like the <a href="images/pikedjaeger.gif">piked Jaeger</a> receiving a 0.1 increase in D-value. Gymnasts are now not allowed to do more than three skills with the same entry (<a href="images/hipcircle.gif">hip circle</a>, <a href="images/toeon.gif">toe-on</a>, <a href="images/stalder.gif">stalder</a>, <a href="images/inbars.gif">inbar</a>), forcing gymnasts to diversify their routine. Laurie Hernandez had a fairly competitive beam routine in the the 2013-2016 code, but four of her elements had a stalder entry, one of which would not have counted in the current code. Lastly, this code is also encouraging more connections between high bar and low bar transitions, so they are now taking deductions after unconnected <a href="images/shaposh.gif">Shaposhnikova</a> variations.

						</div>
						<div class="graph" id="ubgraph">
						</div>
						<p>Bars is where Russia and China shine. Russia's Elena Eremina performs a <a href="images/nabieva.gif">Nabieva</a>, a G-skill, the hardest release being done in the competition. With the highest D-score (6.3), Fan Yilin has beautifully concise routine, doing all of her skills within two connections, along with a unique dismount that could be named after her. Nina Derwael is trying to earn Belgium's first gymnastics medal, and she could have a new release move (a <a href="images/derwael.gif">stalder Tkachev</a> with a half turn) named after her in the process. American Ashton Locklear doesn't have as big of a D-score (5.5) than the other contenders, but she has the best execution by far with her perfect handstands and beautiful lines.She hasn't shown her inbars at selection camp, so we can assume she's not ready to compete them. With inbars, she has a D-score potential of 6.0. Daria Varinska is representing Ukraine, a former country with multiple multiple Olympic all-around winners, but hasn't had a gymnast in the finals since 2010. With her routine, she could qualify to bars finals and have a shot to medal. Romania has been notoriously weak on the uneven bars, but Larisa Iordache has shown incredible improvement on bars, and she could potentially make event finals with her D-score alone (6.2). She is also debuting a Fabrichnova (double twisting double tuck) dismount, an F-skill.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="graphholder">
						<h3> Balance Beam </h3>
						<p> In the new code, several mounts were bumped up by 0.1 in difficulty. In light of Alicia Sacramone's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrPOWTIUiWg">fall</a> on her risky front pike mount at the 2008 Olympic Team Final, the U.S. and other countries have stuck to relatively safe mounts, packing the rest of their routines with difficulty. However, this code is now encouraging gymnasts to do more acrobatic mounts. In addition, this beam code is all about connecting elements, awarding connection bonuses for mixed series (dance + acrobatic). Many gymnasts have been performing a <a href="images/frontaerial.gif">front aerial (D) + split jump (B) + straddle jump (B)</a> for 0.2 connection bonus. The Chinese beam workers have been especially creative with this code, connecting difficult leaps with acrobatic elements.

						</div>

						<p>Larisa Iordache is a favorite to win the beam title, with her two super difficult acrobatic series, which include a <a href="images/layoutfull.gif">layout with a full twist</a> (G) and a <a href="images/tuckfull.gif">full twisting back tuck</a> (F), giving her the highest D-score potential. China's Liu Tingting displays her flexibility in her jumps and leaps, and she does almost all of her skills in connection, racking up over a point in connection bonus. Romania's Catalina Ponor was the 2004 Olympic beam champion, and she is still looking for her first gold medal at Worlds. In true Romanian fashion, she works the beam with a rhythm, moving from skill to skill effortlessly, connecting several elements together. Ragan Smith has been consistent on beam, and she has received the highest E-score this season. Spin queen and 2016 Olympic beam champion Sanne Wevers is also looking for her first Worlds medal, but she has looked less in form than in the previous year.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="graphholder">
						<h3> Floor Exercise </h3>
						<p>Floor has not gone through many changes since the last code, except for a new composition requirement that requires gymnasts to perform both frontward and backward tumbling. In the last quad, Simone Biles dominated all the floor finals, since no one came close to her difficulty in tumbling. Without her at these Worlds, the field is wide open.</p>
						<div class="inputs">
							<label id="fxlabel"><input id="sortfx" type="checkbox"> Sort values</label>
							<label><input class="fxradio" type="radio" name="fxdataset" id="dataset" value="0" checked> Maximum scores</label>
							<label><input class="fxradio" type="radio" name="fxdataset" id="dataset" value="1"> Average Scores    </label>
						</div>
						<div class="graph" id="fxgraph">
						</div>
					<p> Big tumbling is the name of the game here, and most of the contenders compete a <a href="images/chusovitina.gif">full twisting double layout</a>, an H skill named after none other than Oksana Chusovitina. Mai Murakami, Jade Carey, Sae Miyakawa, and Claudia Fragapane all compete one. Catalina Ponor, the 2004 Olympic floor champion, is currently training a Chusovitina, and will debut hers at these Worlds. The two Japanese gymnasts Sae and Mai have the highest D-scores, so they will likely be on the podium. Ragan's D-score isn't as high as some of the gymnasts', but she could medal due to her solid landings and good form. She has the highest E-score.  
					</p>
					</div>
					<h3> 2017 and Looking Onward </h3>
					<p> Since the inception of the new code, the difficulty of routines has gone up even though D-scores don't necessarily reflect this, due to FIG's re-balancing of the code. Because a high D-score is necessary to be competitive for finals, gymnasts are pushing the boundaries of the sport by performing harder and harder skills. Judges are becoming being stricter on the E-score as a result, making sure gymnasts perform the skills correctly and with good form. At the 2017 Worlds, we can expect the judges to be harsh on both the E-score and D-score, deducting the E-score for poor landings and form issues, and deducting from the D-score by downgrading leaps and not rewarding bonuses for slow connections.</p>

					<p>Now that the perfect 10 is gone, its advocates will lament that gymnastics is all about difficulty and less about artistry, the heart of the sport. To some extent, this is true--yet how can we maintain objectivity in judging while promoting artistry? This is the crux of of the problem of judging a sport like gymnastics: the difficulty in trying to creating a code that assigns a numeric scores to routines that can't be measured with a clock or a ruler but rather by how they make us feel. Still, some gymnasts refuse to sacrifice aristry. At these World Championships, keep an eye out for USA's Morgan Hurd and Canada's Brooklyn Moors, whose floor routines are technically difficult and also remind us of why we watch gymnastics--to see beauty and expression personified by bodies in motion.</p>
